The DLR presented their concepts of the Factory of the Future on the Automatica fair 2018. RAFCON played a major role in several demonstrators. 

The Automatica fair takes place every two years and the DLR booth is always a highlight. This year, the Factory of the Future (FoF) accounted for about one third of the booth with in total five demonstrators. Three of these demonstrators made extensive use of RAFCON:

* The SMErobotics group has an assembly planner that automatically build an assembly plan in form of a RAFCON state machine from a CAD drawing.
* The autonomy of the OmniRob of the Mobile Robotics group stems from huge hierarchical state machines communicating using ROS and LN. 
* In the Collaborative Workcell, users can intuitively sequence and parameterize skills. Skills are linked to RAFCON state machines, allowing the execution to be controlled from a tablet interface.  

As it can be seen,  more and more groups at the DLR robotics and mechatronics institute, use RAFCON for a broad spectrum of use cases.
