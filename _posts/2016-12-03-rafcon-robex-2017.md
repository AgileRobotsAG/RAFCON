During the ROBEX mission, our DLR Lightweight Rover Unit autonomously deployed several seismometers in an unknown rough terrain on Mt. Etna, Sicily. Its autonomous behavior was programmed with our behavior framework RAFCON.

We deployed a mobile manipulation platform to autonomously setup a network of seismometers on Mt. Etna, Sicily, Italy; an environment with many similarities to the moon. This moon analogue demonstration mission was conducted with the Lightweight Rover Unit (LRU) in the context of the Robotic Exploration of Extreme Environments (ROBEX) project.
The goal of the mission was to perform seismic measurements with the deployed network in order to infer the geological composition and detailed information about the crust layers of the volcanic target region.
