RAFCON has proofed to be the perfect flow control tool for complex missions like the SpaceBot Camp. The DLR RMC team _RMexplores_ won the event hold in November '15 also thanks to RAFCON.

The DLR RMC (Robotics and Mechatronics Center â€“ DLR RM and DLR SR) participated as team _[RMexplores!][RMexplores]_ in den SpaceBot Camp Presentation on 13th of November 2015. The SpaceBot Camp was organized by the DLR Space Administration. Ten teams from universities and research institutes aimed at fulfilling a challenging task. A mobile system had to explore an unknwon area, find two objects and bring them to a third object for assembly. All tasks had to be done with a high level of autonomy since communication was delayed by 2 seconds and sending commands was limited to only a few occasions. The whole task had to be done in 60 minutes.RMexplores! was the only team that fulfilled all tasks within the given specification. This was accomplished in halve of the time. The whole mission control and autonomous behaviour of the robot was developed with RAFCON.
