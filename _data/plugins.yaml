- name: "Plugin Template"
  description: "An example of how external code can be integrated into RAFCON"
  description: "RAFCON is shipped with a plugin example demonstrating the interfacing to RAFCON with custom code. This example can be used as a template to write your own plugin, e. g. to observe the core elements (with a simple observer) or GUI elements and meta data changes (with more complex and also signal based observers). The template can be found in the RAFCON repository in the share/examples/plugins folder."

- name: "Monitoring Plugin"
  description: "A remote control plugin for distributed robot systems"
  description: "This plugin allows to control the execution of a remote system. A slim RAFCON core has to run on the remote side which can then be controlled via a RAFCON GUI launched on a local PC. The execution of the remote client can easily be monitored as the currently executed states are visualized inside the local RAFCON instance. One remote system can even be monitored by several local clients."

  description: "This plugin can autogenerate the layout of state machines (currently not maintained)"
  description: "The plugin can autogenerate the graphical layout of a state machine using the Graphviz library. Therefore this plugin maps RAFCON elements into Grapviz and backport the layout generated by the Graphviz library into the meta data of state machine elements of RAFCON."
