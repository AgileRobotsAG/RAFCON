- name: "Plugin Templates"
  intro: "An overview of how plugins and respective observers can be integrated"
  description: "RAFCON is shipped with a plugin example demonstrating a plugin interface and its possible usage. This example can be used as template, e. g. to observe the core elements (with a simple observer), GUI elements or meta data changes (with more complex and also signal based observers). Those templates can be found in the RAFCON repo in the share/examples/plugins folder. Additionally, we generated an example for an execution hook plugin which is not included in the repo. This plugin allows to insert scripts/functions that are called on state machine level with hooks on general execution engine status changes and has an editor which is integrated in RAFCON."

- name: "Monitoring Plugin"
  intro: "A remote control plugin for distributed robot systems"
  description: "This plugin allows to control the execution of a remote system. A slim RAFCON core has to run on the remote side which can then be controlled via a RAFCON GUI launched on a local PC. The execution of the remote client can easily be monitored as the currently executed states are visualized on the local RAFCON instance. One remote system can even be monitored by several local clients."
