  description: "At the IAC 2018 booth, RAFCON was executed on multiple robots of the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics.
  Next to two Lightweight rover units (LRUs), also our in-house developed Ardea Hexacopter, was controlled by RAFCON.
   On the Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV), the task execution framework was used for system configuration, waypoint navigation and high-level mission control."

  description: "Recent progress in physical Human‐Robot Interaction (pHRI) research showed in principle that human and robots can actively and safely share a common workspace. The fundamental breakthrough that enabled these results was the human-centered design of robot mechanics and control. This made it possible to limit potential injuries due to unintentional contacts."
