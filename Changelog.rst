This is a big minor release including many changes. State machines
stored with version 0.6.\* are compatible with this version, but not
state machines from older releases. Those have to be opened with 0.6.\*
and then saved again. The following list is probably not complete:

-  Support for `openSUSE Leap <https://rmintra01.robotic.dlr.de/wiki/OpenSUSE_Leap>`__
-  Support for plugins
-  Major design overhaul: agrees with drafts from design and looks
   consistent on all platforms
-  Drag and Drop of states

   -  Libraries from the library tree
   -  Any type of state from the buttons below the graphical state
      editor
   -  The drop position determines the location and the parent of the
      new state

-  All sidebars can now be undocked and moved to another screen
-  Auto store state machine in background and recover after crash
-  Improved history with branches
-  New feature: run until state
-  Extended stepping mode: step into, over and out
-  Redesign remote execution of state machines: Native GUI can be used
   to execute state machine running on different host
-  Drop support of YAML state machine files
-  Rename state machine files
-  Extend documentation
-  `RMC-BuildBot <https://rmintra01.robotic.dlr.de/wiki/Buildbot>`__ support
-  Many bug fixes
-  A lot of refactorings, code optimizations, etc.
