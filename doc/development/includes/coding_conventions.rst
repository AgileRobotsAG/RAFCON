Style guides
""""""""""""

We follow the rules of `PEP-8: Style Guide for Python Code <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__ and the
`DLR Coding Conventions <https://rmintra01.robotic.dlr.de/wiki/File:Code_conventions_python_flyer.pdf>`__ with
some minor exceptions:

- Line length is limited to 120 characters (instead of 79)

For docstrings (and generally for the documentation), we format using `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge
.net/rst.html>`__ for `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc
.org/>`__. More information
on this is available in another `PEP <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287>`__.

PyCharm Coding Style/Conventions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Our recommended tool for development is PyCharm. This IDE makes it easy for you to follow our style guides. We
prepared a settings file for "Code styles" and "Inspection profiles", which you just need to import: `File > Import
Settings > [project root/.idea/recommended_code_style_and_inspections.jar`.
