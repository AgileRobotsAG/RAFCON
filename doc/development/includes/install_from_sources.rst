RAFCON can be also installed from our `GitHub releases <https://github.com/DLR-RM/RAFCON/releases>`__.


If you don't want to edit the source code of RAFCON, it can be installed directly from source:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install /install/directory/rafcon/ --user


If you want to be able to change the source code, you can install RAFCON in editable mode.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --editable /install/directory/rafcon/ --user

Any changes in ``/install/directory/rafcon/source`` will take effect when launching RAFCON.
