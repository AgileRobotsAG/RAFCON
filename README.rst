RAFCON
======

RAFCON (RMC awesome [or advanced] Flow Control, new name, aka Awesome tool) is an effort of DLR RMC to create a new (visual) programming tool for the creation of state-machines. It targets at combining the advantages and features of flow control tools like `Bubbles <https://rmintra01.robotic.dlr.de/wiki/Bubbles>`_ or `SMACH <http://wiki.ros.org/smach>`_ without inheriting their drawbacks.

RAFCON has its `own RMC wiki page <https://rmintra01.robotic.dlr.de/wiki/RAFCON>`_, where you can find more information.
