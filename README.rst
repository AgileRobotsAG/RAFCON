Develop your robotic tasks using an intuitive graphical user interface
----------------------------------------------------------------------

RAFCON uses hierarchical state machines, featuring concurrent state execution, to represent robot programs.
It ships with a graphical user interface supporting the creation of state machines and
contains IDE like debugging mechanisms. Alternatively, state machines can programmatically be generated
using RAFCON's API.

Universal application

  RAFCON is written in Python, can be extended with plugins and is hard- and middleware independent.

Visual programming

  The sophisticated graphical editor can be used for the creation, execution and debugging of state machines.

Collaborative working

  Share and reuse your state machines in form of libraries, stored as JSON strings in text files.
