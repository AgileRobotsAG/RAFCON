To create the *.rst files you have to run (in the directory where the sphinx_howto resides):

sphinx-apidoc . --full -o documentation/

Afterwards you have to run:

sphinx-build . documentation

or use the run configuration in pycharm. To use this you have to set your AWESOME_TOOL_PROJECT_PATH environment variable to your specific awesome_tool directory. Then start pycharm from a shell where the AWESOME_TOOL_PROJECT_PATH environment variable is set.
