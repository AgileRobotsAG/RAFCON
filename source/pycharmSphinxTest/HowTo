How to get the project running:
#################################

Pycharm unfortunately does not support relative paths (like in eclipse ECLIPSE_HOME, PARENT_LOC, PROJECT_LOC and WORKSPACE_LOC)

Thus we have to use system environment variables (that are working only in some setting fields of a pycharm project :-( )

The runconfiguration expects a Variable called SPHINX_TEST_PROJECT_PATH to point at the directory where the HowTo resides.

Thus:
1. export SPHINX_TEST_PROJECT_PATH=/your/path/to/project
2. start pycharm
3. start "createDocumentation"

execute "sphinx-build -b html source-dir target-dir"

source-dir: the directory where the conf.py resides
target-dir: arbitrary directory where the documenation is going to be stored

---

an .rst file has to created that list every module and file that should be in the documentation

the .rst files can either be created manually or generated via:

sphinx-apidoc project_trunk --full -o doc -H 'project_name' -A 'auther' -V '0.1'

where:
project_trunk is the root directory of the source code 
doc is the folder, where the .rst files are going to be stored
