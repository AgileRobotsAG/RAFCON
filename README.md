# RAFCON

RAFCON (RMC awesome [or advanced] Flow Control, new name, aka Awesome tool) is an effort of DLR RMC to create a new (visual) programming tool for the creation of state-machines. It targets at combining the advantages and features of flow control tools like [Bubbles](https://rmintra01.robotic.dlr.de/wiki/Bubbles) or [SMACH](http://wiki.ros.org/smach) without inheriting their drawbacks.

RAFCON has its [own RMC wiki page](https://rmintra01.robotic.dlr.de/wiki/RAFCON), where you can find more information.
